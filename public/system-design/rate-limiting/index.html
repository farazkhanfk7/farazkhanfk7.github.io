Protects servers from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
Reduces the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) and other security threats.
Ensures all users have fair access to the system&rsquo;s resources.


  Cons:

    <p>Rate limiting is an essential practice in backend systems to manage the number of requests a user or application can make to a server within a given time period. By doing this, it helps maintain the server’s stability, ensures fair usage, and protects against abuse like DDoS attacks.

<ul>
<li>Visualize a container that holds tokens.</li>
<li>This container has a fixed capacity, meaning it can only store a certain number of tokens at once.</li>
<li>Tokens are added to the container at a steady rate, for example, 10 tokens every second.</li>
<li>When a request comes in, it needs to take a token from the container to proceed.</li>
<li>If there are sufficient tokens available, the request is approved, and the corresponding number of tokens is removed.</li>
<li>If the container doesn’t have enough tokens, the request is rejected or delayed until more tokens are available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Leaky Bucket algorithm</strong> is designed to manage bursts of traffic by regulating the flow more steadily.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">

<ul>
<li>Picture a bucket with a tiny hole at the bottom.</li>
<li>Incoming requests are added to the bucket from the top.</li>
<li>The bucket processes, or &ldquo;leaks,&rdquo; the requests at a fixed, constant rate through the hole.</li>
<li>If the bucket fills up and overflows, additional incoming requests are dropped until there&rsquo;s room again.</li>

</h3>
<p>While the Token Bucket and Leaky Bucket algorithms are good choices to understand how rate-limiting works, there are several other rate-limiting methods worth exploring. One such approach is the <strong>Sliding Window</strong>, which provides a more flexible way to track and limit requests over time. Depending on your use case, each algorithm has its own advantages and trade-offs, making it important to choose the right one for your system.</p>
